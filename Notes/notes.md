# Notes

## All sites have these issues

- Header navigation has major contrast issues with the video hero background. Recommendation: Have some kind of dark somewhat transparent background provinding the needed contrast. Related image ./Images/riveroakspark-header-navigation.png 

- Typography of the hero message has too much spacing between lines causeing the typography to feel disjointed and not grouped together. Recomendation: tighten the spacing between headline rows so they feel grouped together. Related Image: ./Images/riveroakspark-hero-message.png

- Other Amenities section lacks expected interactivity. As a prospect I really likely really care about the amenities or the unique features of the RV park. on the home page there is an "Our Amenities" section with nice visuales however the action is a small "Learn More" above them. As a user I would like to interact with each amenitie by clicking the more visual captivating images. Related Image: ./Images/riveroakspark-our-amenities.png

- Noticed what I will call a bug with some of the top navigation where a bottom border under the navigation will show up or look off. Related Image:./Images/riveroakspark-our-amenities.png

- Contrast issues with text on images showing amenities, some sitles like river oaks avoid this some with a dark graident overlay. Recommendation:  Making having the gradient overlay or a consistant color background for all text that goes over images a template standard.

## Mobile

- Mobile view struggles with the large 100vh video preview much more than desktop, The CTA "Book Now" is mostly cutoff, there is a lot of space for the top navigation menu and the message headline is towards the bottom. Recomendation: Create a mobile optimized version of layout with a more vertically compact top navigation, and a hero section that keeps the CTA and inital message clearly in focus. Additinoally if you have a full vertical height hero section you should add an indication that there is more content below the fold. Related Image: riveroakspark-mobile-first-impression.png
