# All sites have these issues

- Header navigation has major contrast issues with the video hero background. Recommendation: Have some kind of dark somewhat transparent background provinding the needed contrast. Related image ./Images/riveroakspark-header-navigation.png 

- Typography of the hero message has too much spacing between lines causeing the typography to feel disjointed and not grouped together. Recomendation: tighten the spacing between headline rows so they feel grouped together. Related Image: ./Images/riveroakspark-hero-message.png

- Other Amenities section lacks expected interactivity. As a prospect I really likely really care about the amenities or the unique features of the RV park. on the home page there is an "Our Amenities" section with nice visuales however the action is a small "Learn More" above them. As a user I would like to interact with each amenitie by clicking the more visual captivating images. Related Image: ./Images/riveroakspark-our-amenities.png

- Noticed what I will call a bug with some of the top navigation where a bottom border under the navigation will show up or look off. Related Image:./Images/riveroakspark-our-amenities.png
